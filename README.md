# CS-5934-capstone-deliverables

This team project was completed in the Spring of 2022. Overall, the web application allows users to search for event data, like live music shows, and displays those results on a map. Searches can be customized with date ranges, location ranges, and searching on specific artists or venues. The following tech stack was used:

Docker

MySQL

Flask.py

Python

Vue.js/Vuetify

The web application queries TicketMaster and Stubhub APIs, and integrates Google's mapping and location autocomplete features for a professional look.
